# Bash Scripting Exercises

A collection of Bash scripts developed during my Software Engineering training at Endava Uruguay. These scripts automate common system administration tasks and demonstrate practical shell scripting techniques.

## Overview

This repository contains practical Bash scripts created as part of a professional training program. The scripts cover topics such as:

- Directory navigation and inspection
- File operations (creation, copying, moving, deletion)
- Viewing and searching text content
- Process monitoring and control
- SSH service management and command history usage
- File permissions and ownership management

Each script is documented with comments to explain its purpose and usage.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the scripts on a Linux system with Bash.  
Some scripts may require `sudo` privileges for administrative tasks.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:codenamecoffee/Linux_Scripting_Exercises.git
cd your-repo
bash scriptname.sh
```
